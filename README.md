# StenoBlast
#### A little stenotyping-oriented interactive Anki deck, for practicing words.

## Install

This is a [Processing](https://processing.org) project folder. Install Processing 3, clone the repo, and play straight from the download!

## How to use it?

You need [Plover](https://openstenoproject.org/plover) with its default settings. The game might not work correctly with non-standard settings. Turn it on before you start playing the game.

Right now, pressing space on the home screen will pull up the cards that are due to be studied now. The deck is stored in `data/deck.csv`.

## License

All the resources, including the chimes, are mine.

My deck (which is in the repo as well) is based on [Art of Chording](https://www.artofchording.com).
